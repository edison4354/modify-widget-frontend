# Modify Widget

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Build customized Notion documents with our personalized widgets you can embed into Notion.

Creating customizable widgets and mini apps for your Notion. There is a user friendly website where anyone can quickly and easily customize one of the widgets we will have on our platform. Currently only a music widget that has downloaded songs are available but more widgets are in progress including a synced google calendar widget, stock/crypto tracker, and a countdown date ( Anticipate important events ). Here is the walk through of how our product works. A user would first visit our site where you can create an account. Once that is done you have a dashboard with a “Create” button to start the process of a new widget. Then after the widget is done being customized you can continue and a url for you to embed on notion will appear. You can save your widget at the end of this project and revisit them to make any changes on the dashboard.
